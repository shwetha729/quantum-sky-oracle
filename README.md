# quantum-sky-oracle
A generalized quantum diagram &amp; process to apply in multidisciplinary use-cases,  using errsela robot :) 

- overview of quantum concepts
-  overview of applications
- understand its present limitations
- use Eigen quantum C++ 
- use Twist programming language
- use  Covalent workflow for python option
- knowledge base via Obsidian 
- arline benchmarks
- later: connect to Errsela to oracle
